Nice to meet you! My name is Hunter Hancock. I'm originally from San Francisco, but now I go to school at Georgia Tech where I study Computer Science. I'm particularly focused on machine learning and human-computer interaction.

I enjoy a wide range of topics - from development and design to entrepreneurship and venture capital to soccer, astronomy, and politics. I like finding unique connections and insights in one domain that I can apply to others.

I look forward to getting to know you! You can email me [here](mailto:hunterghancock@gmail.com) and find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LldW3FPyzk0J7bkO_9mELxtNeqvetG3a/view?usp=sharing).
