  This semester, I worked with a team of two other Georgia Tech students to
  propose a solution to the Department of Energy's annual JUMP into STEM
  Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings challenge. The solution we came up with
  employs a form of energy storage that currently sits dormant in almost every
  home across the country: water heaters. These often-neglected but ubiquitous
  devices allow for significant energy shifting in order to reduce peak energy
  loads, with potential peak reductions of more than 10% using our proposed
  algorithm.

I'm proud to say that we [won the 2020-21 DOE challenge](https://iac.gatech.edu/news/item/642162/georgia-tech-students-jump-into-stem-third-consecutive-year)!
