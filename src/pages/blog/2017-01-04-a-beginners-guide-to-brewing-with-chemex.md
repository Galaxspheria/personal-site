  Hidden Features was created as part of Georgia Tech ENGL 1102. While the
  entire class collaborated to create content, I took the lead on website
  development, building the site in React with a team of four other students.

> The purpose of this project was to bring attention to the hidden films and female authors that helped evolve film in the Early Hollywood Studio Era. Our final project is a website that includes a timeline divided by decade from 1910-1960 and pages focusing on the impact of each film within the decade along with background information on the authors. We decided that a website would be the best format to present this information because it is the most accessible to our audience and allows for more design flexibility than a paper format. Several project members also have experience in web design and web development.
