  This summer I had a fantastic experience working on the PowerBI Creators team.
  Over the course of my 12 weeks at Microsoft, I took a highly-requested feature
  from concept to design to execution and deployment. I couldn't have done it
  without an awesome team - huge thanks to Matt, Gilberto, Alper, Erik, and Rien
  for all their support throughout the summer.
