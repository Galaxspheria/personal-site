  Over the past six months, I've had the incredible opportunity to lead a team
  of freelance developers in building the new rodneysmith.com. This site is the
  product of a lot of love - more than a year of initial planning and design
  followed by many months of development, tweaks, and iteration, all to honor an
  entire lifetime spent in pursuit of artistic perfection.

We had a lot of fun making it. I hope you have a lot of fun exploring its eccentricities.
