  I had the fantastic opportunity to participate in Lyft's 2019 Data Challenge,
  where a teammate and I were provided with three months of real Lyft ride data.
  We utilized a number of methods for data analysis to come to our final
  conclusions, doing our best to present them in a readily consumable format for
  a cross-functional audience.
