Expreseeva was created with a team of five as part of the 2018-2019 cohort of Georgia Tech's [Grand Challenges](http://grandchallenges.gatech.edu/) program.

Over the course of the project, we did everything from market and medical research to design and development. We modeled, printed, and constructed a stand for tracking user inputs to a letterboard with the ultimate goal of removing the need for a human third-party for outward communication.
