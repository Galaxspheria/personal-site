  Over the past two months, I've worked with a phenomenal group of four
  undergrads to compete in Amazon's Master's level data science challenge.
  Though the competition was intended for students in Georgia Tech's Master's in
  Analytics program, we managed to convince the organizers to let us
  participate. Over the two phases of the project we learned a ton, ultimately
  placing in the top 4 against more than 40 teams of Master's students.
